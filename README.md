    git clone https://github.com/anthonygedeon/chip8.git
    cd chip8
    ```

2. Create a build directory and run CMake:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    ```

3. Compile the emulator:
    ```sh
    make
    ```

### Running the Emulator

1. Place your Chip 8 ROMs in the `roms` directory.

2. Run the emulator with a ROM:
    ```sh
    ./chip8 roms/your-rom-file.ch8
    ```
3. Or run the test roms in the `test-roms` directory
    ```sh
    ./chip8 test-roms/chip8-test-suite.ch8
    ```
